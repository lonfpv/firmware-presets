# -- FPV Angle Mix --
# FPV mix degrees: Automatically coordinates roll and yaw
# Only active when FPV Angle Mix mode is active
# JB recommends 50% of camera uptilt
# Invalid name in Betaflight 4.3
# set fpv_mix_degrees = 10
# From 4.1 documentation: 
# BF Configurator: FPV Camera Angle [degrees]
# Camera tilt angle in degrees that should be compensated 
# for when enabling FPV Angle Mix mode. It can be used to 
# fly FPV as if the camera was tilted differently. 
# Also known as uptilt compensation.
